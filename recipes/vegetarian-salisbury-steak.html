            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1¾ cups vegetable broth</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice one onion half and set aside. Mince the remaining onion half and place in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef substitute, bread crumbs, egg, 1/2 of the garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the minced onion. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. Divide into 4 equal patties.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 of the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove patties to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add remaining olive oil, reserved onion slices, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 3/4 cups vegetable broth, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining garlic powder; stir to combine and season with salt and pepper. Return patties to the pan, reduce heat, and simmer until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove patties and plate them. Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons vegetable broth into a slurry; add slurry to the skillet. Cook and stir until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle hot sauce over cooked patties.</li>
